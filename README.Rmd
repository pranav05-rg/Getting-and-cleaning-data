# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Set the working directory to the downloaded database.
2. Load the training and test data respectively.
3. Merge the test and training data into one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
6. Label the data set with appropriate variable names.
7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

THE RESULTANT DATA SET IS STORED AS A TEXT FILE NAMED "tidydata.txt"
